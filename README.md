## Social Networks
### Instagram
<img width="16" src="misc/forbidden.png"> </img> Don't use instagram (or at least the official client). Instagram is a very privacy-invasive app with biased results and feeds based on user profiles, it is also used as a manipulation tool and has a lot of censorship going against free speech. Lastly, it has an addictive and toxic ui-design.

<img width="16" src="misc/check.png"> </img> **Instead Use:**
* [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) - Decentralized, federated and Open Source alternative to Instagram with posts, videos, stories, tags, etc.
* [Barinsta](http://barinsta.austinhuang.me/) - The beautiful, open source, and privacy-friendly alternative Instagram client for Android.

## Youtube
<img width="16" src="misc/forbidden.png"> </img> Don't use YouTube (or at least the official client). Youtube is very privacy invasive, it generates a very accurate profile based on your interests. Also it is a [radicalization tool](https://www.pcmag.com/news/does-youtubes-algorithm-lead-to-radicalization) which shows [biased content to users](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08313.pdf) in order to get more engadgement and to get them to watch more and more content creating an [adiction](https://medium.com/dataseries/how-youtube-is-addictive-259d5c575883). It never shows you [alternative opinions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08313.pdf) to your ideology/bias. Youtube censors a lot. Youtube collects a LOT of your data: interesnts, free time, ideology, likes, dislikes, music taste, etc...

<img width="16" src="misc/check.png"> </img> **Instead Use:**
* [Peertube](https://joinpeertube.org/en/) - A free, open and decentralized alternative to video platforms.
* [LBRY](https://lbry.tv/) - LBRY is a secure, open, and community-run digital marketplace. Enjoy the latest content from your favorite creators - as a user, not a product.

<img width="16" src="misc/check.png"> </img> **Privacy respecting Youtube clients:**
- [Yotter](https://github.com/ytorg/yotter) - Youtube and Twitter with privacy. Never share any of your data to Youtube, yet be able to watch Youtube videos.
- [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) - Alternative and privacy respecting Youtube frontend.
