## Social Networks
### Instagram
<img width="16" src="misc/forbidden.png"> </img> Don't use instagram (or at least the official client). Instagram is a very privacy-invasive app with biased results and feeds based on user profiles, it is also used as a manipulation tool and has a lot of censorship going against free speech. Lastly, it has an addictive and toxic ui-design.

* [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) - Decentralized, federated and Open Source alternative to Instagram with posts, videos, stories, tags, etc.
