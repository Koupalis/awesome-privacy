# About this list
This list is intended to gather all the projects that help users to safeguard their privacy and keep their data private in all digital fields and perspectives.

If you want to **add** a service, just fork this project and create a PR with you additions. I will review the new services you listed and merge it if they are fine, if there are any kind of doubts we will discuss them on the PR comment section.

If you think or find that a listed service is **not respecting** users privacy, please open an issue and we will discuss about it, and if it is needed it will be delisted.
